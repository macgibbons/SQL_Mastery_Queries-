---------- Selling a Vehicle ----------
-- Carnival would like to create a stored procedure that handles the case of updating their vehicle inventory when a sale occurs. 
-- They plan to do this by flagging the vehicle as is_sold which is a field on the Vehicles table. 
-- When set to True this flag will indicate that the vehicle is no longer available in the inventory. 
-- Why not delete this vehicle? We don't want to delete it because it is attached to a sales record.
---------- Returning a Vehicle ----------
-- Carnival would also like to handle the case for when a car gets returned by a customer. 
-- When this occurs they must add the car back to the inventory and mark the original sales record as returned = True.
-- Carnival staff are required to do an oil change on the returned car before putting it back on the sales floor.
-- In our stored procedure, we must also log the oil change within the OilChangeLog table.
